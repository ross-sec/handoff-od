# The bundle contract (Mechanism A)

What phase 01 builds and phase 03 enforces. Every rule here is recovered from real handoff
bundles, not from documentation.

## Naming

| Thing | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| archive | `<Project Display Name>-handoff.zip` | `Nova Reader App-handoff.zip` |
| companion | `<Project Display Name>-handoff.tar.gz` | — |
| root dir | project name, lower-kebab | `nova-reader-app/` |

The `-handoff` suffix is the discriminator — a plain project export drops it. Slugging is NFKD
normalize, strip diacritics, lowercase, every run of non-`[a-z0-9]` to `-`, collapse repeats, trim.

Verified against four real project names, including `Studio CSS - Base Set` -> `studio-css-base-set`.

## Tree

```
<project-slug>/
├── README.md            # generated
├── AGENTS.md            # ours, pointer only, rootPointers=true
├── CLAUDE.md            # ours, pointer only, rootPointers=true
├── chats/               # includeChats=true
└── project/             # verbatim mirror
```

**Root purity.** Real bundles contain exactly `README.md` + `project/` and nothing else. The two
pointer files are our only divergence and are gated behind `rootPointers` for anyone who wants
strict parity. Everything else at root is a bug and phase 03 fails on it.

## The README

One generated file. Slots: `{{ENTRY_DIRECTIVE}}`, `{{DESIGN_SYSTEM}}`, `{{CONTENTS}}` — plus the
slug and project name interpolated inside them. Phase 01 fails if any `{{SLOT}}` survives.

`{{ENTRY_DIRECTIVE}}` has two forms:

- **Form 1** — an entry file is known. Names it, says the user had it open at trigger time,
  mandates reading it in full then following its imports.
- **Form 2** — none known. Says to find the primary design file, then the same import rule.

The entry file comes from `get_active_context()`. Do not guess one; Form 2 is a valid outcome.

When `includeChats` is on, a chats directive is prepended: the intent lives in the conversation, the
files are only what that intent produced.

### The six decisions

Preserve all six in any rewording. They are the actual product:

1. Mandated reading order — entry file in full, then transitively follow imports.
2. Anti-skim.
3. Anti-screenshot — the source is complete; a screenshot costs a round trip to learn nothing.
4. Prototype != production — match the visual result, not the internal structure.
5. Clarify before building.
6. Framework-agnostic.

## The mirror

`project/` is byte-verbatim. **Never** rename, re-suffix, reformat or prune.

The `.jsx.txt` / `.d.ts.txt` suffix seen inside Open Design is added by **OD's importer** on the way
in. The exporter ships plain `.jsx` / `.d.ts`. Reproducing the `.txt` would be a bug; phase 01 and
phase 03 both check for it.

Excluded: `_ds_sync.json` (inbound-sync bookkeeping, deliberately absent from every real bundle),
`.git/`, `node_modules/`, `.handoff/`.

Copied if the project has them, generated never: `CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`. A `project/CLAUDE.md` is
a user-authored note that happens to live in the project. Treat its presence as incidental.

## The design system

Copied whole into `project/_ds/<ds-slug>-<uuid>/`, **plus a short alias directory** carrying
duplicate `_ds_bundle.css` / `_ds_bundle.js` / `fonts/`. The alias is the name the HTML actually
references; ship one without the other and the prototypes render unstyled. Gated as I3.

A design-system-kind project **is** the design system: its manifest sits at the project root with no
`_ds/` wrapper and no alias. Both layouts are detected automatically.

Payload: `README.md`, `styles.css`, `_ds_bundle.css`, `_ds_bundle.js`, `_ds_manifest.json`,
`_adherence.oxlintrc.json`, `tokens/tokens.json`, `fonts/`, and conditionally `components/`.

**Two shapes:**

| Source | `components/` | Detect by |
|---|---|---|
| project-local | expanded — `<group>/<Name>/{jsx,d.ts,html,prompt.md}` | `components/` exists |
| published npm library | collapsed into `_ds_bundle.js` | it does not |

### `_ds_manifest.json`

```
namespace  components[{name,sourcePath}]  startingPoints  cards[{path,group,viewport}]
templates  hasThumbnailHtml  globalCssPaths[]  tokens[{name,value,kind,definedIn}]
themes  fonts  brandFonts  source
```

`tokens[].kind` is one of `color`, `glass`, `radius`, `elevation`, `type`, `motion`.

### Tokens

There is **no single canonical token format**, and normalizing would be wrong. Observed carriers:
`tokens/tokens.json` (W3C-ish, `$name` + `$description` + kind groups), `styles.css` +
`_ds_bundle.css` custom properties, a standalone `tokens.css`. Phase 00 records which one the
project uses; the mirror copies it as-is.

## Offline-completeness

A bundle should render with no network. Real bundles ship actual `.woff2` binaries plus
`fonts/fonts.css` rather than font-CDN links.

**But this is a property of the source, not an invariant we can enforce.** The mirror is verbatim,
so a project whose stylesheet `@import`s a remote font, or whose HTML loads React from a CDN,
produces a bundle that needs the network. Both occur in real bundles.

Phase 03 therefore **warns** rather than fails, and `--strict` escalates. Never "fix" it by
rewriting the mirror — that breaks a hard invariant to satisfy a soft one.

## No manifest

Real bundles carry no `manifest.json`, no `handoff.json`, no `bundle.json`. **The tree shape is the
schema.** Adding one would be diverging, not improving. Our own bookkeeping lives outside the
bundle, in `.handoff/`.

Likewise: never `HANDOFF.md`, never `IMPLEMENTATION.md`. The instruction file is `README.md`.

## Invariants

| Id | Rule |
|---|---|
| I1 | `project/` is verbatim — never rename, re-suffix, reformat |
| I2 | Offline-completeness is reported, never manufactured |
| I3 | Canonical design-system dir and its alias both ship |
| I4 | `_ds_sync.json` never ships |
| I5 | No manifest, no screenshots — convention over schema |
| I6 | `README.md` is the sole instruction carrier; pointers point, never duplicate |
| I7 | Adherence config only when a design system is bound; derived, never hand-written |
| I8 | Archive only after phase 03 writes `ok: true` **for the tree being archived** |
| I9 | Nothing outside the project directory is ever mirrored, named or read |
| I10 | An advertised option is a promise: every declared input is wired to behaviour and checked by a gate |

### I8 in practice

"Unvalidated" has to mean *this tree*, not a tree that once lived at this path. A
verdict carrying only `ok` is a claim about a path, and a path can be rebuilt or
edited underneath it — so phase 04 would archive a tree phase 03 never inspected
while I8 still claimed otherwise. The omitted checks are not cosmetic: root purity,
symlink rejection, spec completeness and adherence consistency all live in phase 03.

Two independent mechanisms, because either alone leaves a hole:

1. **Cleared on mutation.** Phase 01 deletes `.handoff/validate.json` and
   `archive.json` before it touches the bundle — after its own refusals, so a
   *rejected* build never costs you a good verdict. A `--force` rebuild therefore
   leaves nothing for phase 04 to accept.
2. **Bound to a digest.** Phase 03 records a `treeHash` over every path and its
   content, and phase 04 recomputes it and refuses on any difference. That covers the
   edit phase 01 never saw. Content only — no mtimes, no build timestamps — so an
   identical rebuild stays valid and a changed one does not.

Neither mechanism proves the *archiver* read the tree they vouch for. Between
`hashTree` and the archiver's `open()` the directory is still writable — by another
agent working in the output tree, by a racing build, by a substituted tool — so a
file can be swapped under the same name and land in the archive. Comparing entry
names cannot see that, and comparing counts is weaker still: it accepts an archive
that dropped one file and gained another.

So phase 03 records a **per-file** digest, and phase 04 decodes the finished archive
and compares the sha256 of every regular file it actually contains against that
record. Three failure modes are reported separately — missing, unexpected, and
"contents that are not what phase 03 validated". An archive that fails is **deleted**,
along with `archive.json`: a non-zero exit is not enough when the file would still be
sitting there looking finished.

The archive is decoded in-process (zip central directory + `inflateRaw`, tar via
`gunzip` and 512-byte headers, including GNU `L` and pax `x` long names) rather than
by shelling out to an extractor. Partly portability — GNU tar cannot read a zip — but
mostly independence: running the check through the same external tool family that
wrote the archive would let one lying tool vouch for another.

Because the digest walk refuses unsafe symlinks, a link planted after validation
would not change the hash — so phase 04 checks the bundle for links directly before
the archiver can follow one.

A verdict written by a release that predates the digest is refused rather than
trusted.

### I9 in practice

A symlink is not a design file, and `Dirent.isDirectory()` describes the *link*, not
its target — so an unclassified walk hands every link to `copyFileSync`, which either
copies an external target's bytes into the bundle or throws (`EISDIR` on POSIX,
`EPERM` on Windows) and aborts the mirror.

The policy is applied to the **resolved** target:

| Link resolves | Outcome |
|---|---|
| under the project root | followed, and materialized as its target's content — the bundle must stay self-contained, and zip/tar would flatten the link anyway |
| under the root but excluded (`node_modules`, `.git`, sync bookkeeping) | skipped exactly as the target would be, so a link is not a way around `NEVER_SHIP` |
| outside the root | **refused** — phase 00 fails its gate, phase 01 exits 2 before writing or deleting anything |
| nowhere (dangling) | **refused** — a mirror that silently omits a file is not verbatim |

The same rule covers raw path input, which bypasses the walker entirely: `--entry`,
`--files` and `--focus` are each rejected when they resolve outside the project, and
`designSystem.dir` is re-checked when read back from `state.json`. Phase 03 then
asserts the finished bundle contains no symlinks at all — any survivor is a hole the
archive would flatten or drop.

An explicitly supplied `--chats-dir` is the one path allowed to sit outside the
project. I9 governs what the tool *discovers*; that directory is named by the
operator, and the transcript it holds does not live in the project on disk.

### I10 in practice

`depth` shipped for three releases as a declared input that phase 00 wrote into
`state.json` and **nothing ever read**. The documented order ran phase 01 before
phase 02, so the mirror was snapshotted before the spec existed and no phase
refreshed it: `depth=both` produced an archive with no spec in it, and every gate
still reported `PASS`. `includeChats` was worse in kind — it was read, but only to
add a `chats/` line to the README and permit `chats` at bundle root, while nothing
ever created the directory. The README named a path the bundle did not contain.

Two mechanisms keep that from recurring:

1. **Structural.** `hod-validate.js --self` and the test suite both assert that every
   input in `open-design.json` is read back somewhere as `options.<name>`. Declaring
   an input without wiring it fails the packaging check.
2. **Behavioural.** Each option is asserted in the *built tree*, not inferred from the
   fact that a phase ran: phase 01 gates `authored spec nested in the mirror` and
   `conversation transcript included`, and phase 03 re-checks both against the
   directory the archive is made from.

The structural check is necessary, not sufficient — `includeChats` would have passed
it. The behavioural gates are what caught that one.
