 * One pass over a tree, classifying every entry.

 * I9 — nothing outside the project directory is ever mirrored.
 *
 * A symlink is not a design file, and `Dirent.isDirectory()` is FALSE for one
 * even when it points at a directory — the Dirent describes the link, not its
 * target. An unclassified walk therefore hands every symlink to `copyFileSync`,
 * which then either
 *   - follows it and writes the TARGET's bytes into the bundle as a regular
 *     file, silently disclosing whatever lived outside the project, or
 *   - throws (EISDIR on POSIX, EPERM on Windows) for a directory link and
 *     aborts the handoff mid-mirror, leaving a partial bundle.
 *
 * The policy is applied to the RESOLVED target, not the link:
 *   - resolves under the project root -> followed, and mirrored as its target's
 *     content. Materializing rather than preserving the link is deliberate: the
 *     bundle has to stay self-contained, and zip/tar plus a Windows extract
 *     would flatten or break the link anyway.
 *   - resolves anywhere else, or does not resolve -> refused, listed by
 *     `symlinkScan().unsafe`, and hard-gated in phases 00, 01 and 03. Never
 *     silently dropped: a mirror that quietly omits a file is not verbatim.
 *
 * A link whose target is inside the root but EXCLUDED (`node_modules`, `.git`,
 * sync bookkeeping) is skipped exactly as the target itself would be —
 * otherwise a symlink is a way around `NEVER_SHIP`.
