# Handoff to OpenCode

Turn an **Open Design** project into something **OpenCode** can implement from, faithfully.

This is the open-source counterpart of the proprietary design-to-code handoff: the **same process**,
with both ends open. It is also the return leg of the loop `@ross-sec/sync-od` opened, which is what
makes the round trip actually close:

```
sync-od     : codebase      ->  Open Design      (already shipped)
handoff-od  : Open Design   ->  OpenCode         (this plugin)
```

OpenCode is the default receiving end, but nothing here is OpenCode-specific: the bundle is
harness-neutral (`AGENTS.md` is the entry point) and `--agent` targets any `od mcp install` client —
`claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `pi` and the rest. Tell the receiving agent it can push its work back
with `sync-od`; that sentence is what turns a one-way export into a loop.

**Bundled scripts do the mechanical work.** Run ONE phase at a time, read its gate, then run the
next. Every phase writes a real artifact to a real path; a phase that has not passed its gate is
not done, no matter how good the plan looked.

## The one idea

A handoff is **not** a zip. A handoff is **an instruction to an agent**, and the zip is one way to
carry it. There are two mechanisms and they are frequently confused:

| | **A — bundle** | **B — spec** |
|---|---|---|
| Made by | scripts, **no model tokens** | you, authoring |
| Root | `<project-slug>/` | `design_handoff_<feature>/` |
| Says | "read the source, here it all is" | "here is exactly what to build" |
| Cost | seconds | a full turn |

`depth=both` (the default) nests B inside A — the same composition real handoff bundles show.

## Golden rules

1. **RUN the scripts.** Never hand-write a bundle tree, a README, an adherence config, or a token
   table. `scripts/` emits all of them. Hand-written output drifts from the gates and fails 03.
2. **The mirror is verbatim.** Never rename, re-suffix, reformat, or "tidy" anything under
   `project/`. If the source ships `Button.jsx`, the bundle ships `Button.jsx` — not `Button.jsx.txt`.
3. **One phase at a time.** Read the gate output before moving on. `BLOCKED` means stop and fix.
4. **Derive, never invent.** Every token, hex, path and prop traces to a file you read this run.
   No hex outside the extracted palette. No route you did not find in the prototype.
5. **`README.md` is the sole instruction carrier.** `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` may point at it;
   they never duplicate it, and nothing else lands at bundle root.
6. **Never archive an unvalidated tree.** Phase 04 refuses without the phase-03 verdict, and that
   refusal is correct — a half-built bundle that looks finished is worse than no bundle.
7. **Ask before assuming scope.** When `depth` includes `spec`, the feature boundary is the user's
   call, not yours.

## Phases

Scripts live in this plugin's `scripts/`. Run them with `node`, from the directory you want the
bundle written to (`--out` overrides).

Run them in **this order**. The numbering is the phase, not the sequence:

| Order | # | Command | Emits | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 00 | `hod-detect.js --project-name <name> --project-dir <cwd> [--entry <file>]` | `.handoff/state.json` | entry mode, design system, token carrier, options satisfiable |
| 2 | 02 | `hod-spec.js --feature "<scope>"` | `design_handoff_<slug>/` in the **source project** | skeleton + prototypes copied |
| 3 | — | *author the spec over its TODO markers*, then `hod-validate.js --spec` | — | no TODO markers left |
| 4 | 01 | `hod-bundle.js [--force]` | `<slug>/` | slots filled, mirror verbatim, DS + alias, adherence, spec nested |
| 5 | 03 | `hod-validate.js [--strict]` | `.handoff/validate.json` | see below |
| 6 | 04 | `hod-archive.js [--format zip\|targz\|both]` | `<Project Name>-handoff.zip` + `.tar.gz` | entry count |
| — | — | `hod-prompt.js --transport mcp\|zip\|both` | `.handoff/prompt.txt` | — |

**02 runs before 01, and that ordering is load-bearing.** Phase 02 writes the spec into the
*source project*; phase 01 takes a single verbatim snapshot of that project and no later phase
refreshes it. Bundle first and the spec is simply absent from the archive — every gate still passes,
and the `depth=both` deliverable is silently missing. Phase 01 refuses to run at `depth=both` until
the authored, TODO-free spec exists, so the ordering is enforced rather than merely written down.

Skip 02 when `depth=bundle` — the script refuses at that depth. Skip 01/04 when `depth=spec` — same.

### Getting the facts in

Scripts never call MCP. **You** fetch the Open Design facts and pass them as flags:

- `--project-name` — the project's display name. Drives the slug and the archive name.
- `--project-dir` — the project cwd on disk.
- `--entry` — the **active file**, from `get_active_context()`. This is the analogue of the design
  tool reading your open editor tab, and it decides which of the two README forms is written.
  Omit it and the bundle tells the agent to find the primary design file itself.

## Transport — the prompt is the primary path

The product this reproduces defaults to **a copyable prompt**, not a download; the archive sits
behind an overflow menu. Mirror that:

- `transport=mcp` — emit a prompt telling the agent to read the project live over Open Design's own
  MCP (`od mcp install <agent>`; `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `cursor`, `pi` and more). Nothing to
  unpack, never stale. Best when the agent runs on this machine.
- `transport=zip` — emit the archive plus a prompt that points at it. Best when the agent is
  elsewhere, offline, or has no MCP.
- `transport=both` — do both and let the user pick.

**File selection shapes the prompt, never the archive.** `hod-prompt.js --focus a.html,b.html`
narrows what the agent is told to read first; the bundle always carries the whole project. That
asymmetry is deliberate — the agent should be able to look beyond the selection.

`hod-prompt.js` also walks the focused HTML for `<script src>`, `<link href>`, `<img src>`,
`<iframe src>`, `<x-import from>` and `@import`, and lists the local files it finds under
*"Also read these files the selection imports"*.

## The bundle

```
<project-slug>/
├── README.md         # the instruction carrier — generated, never hand-written
├── AGENTS.md         # pointer (rootPointers=true)
├── CLAUDE.md         # pointer (rootPointers=true)
├── chats/            # only when includeChats=true, from --chats-dir
└── project/          # verbatim mirror
    ├── <Design>.dc.html  support.js  .thumbnail
    ├── _ds/<ds-slug>-<uuid>/   # the design system, whole
    ├── _ds/<short-alias>/      # what the HTML actually <script src>'s — both must exist
    └── design_handoff_*/       # B-folders, when depth=both
```

The README encodes six decisions. Preserve every one; they are the product, not decoration:

1. **Mandated reading order** — entry file in full, then transitively follow its imports.
2. **Anti-skim** — top to bottom.
3. **Anti-screenshot** — do not render or screenshot unless asked. The source is complete, and a
   screenshot costs a round trip to learn nothing.
4. **Prototype != production** — reproduce the visual result, not the prototype's internals.
5. **Clarify before building.**
6. **Framework-agnostic** — whatever the target codebase already uses.

### The design system, and why the alias matters

The bound design system is copied **whole**, and a short alias directory sits beside the canonical
UUID one because that is the name the HTML actually references. Ship one without the other and the
prototypes render unstyled. Phase 01 gates this (I3).

Two shapes, detected automatically: a **project-local** design system ships expanded
`components/<group>/<Name>/{jsx,d.ts,html,prompt.md}`; a **published library** collapses into
`_ds_bundle.js`. Do not try to expand a collapsed one.

### `_adherence.oxlintrc.json` — fidelity you can check

The highest-value thing in the bundle, and the easiest to overlook. A generated oxlint config that
polices the **target** codebase: raw hex, raw `px`, fonts the system does not provide, imports that
reach into component internals, props a component does not declare, and inline string-literal
unions constrained to their allowed values.

Generated from `_ds_manifest.json` plus each component's `.d.ts` — **never by hand**; see
`references/adherence.md`. Emitted only when a design system is bound. If the source already has
one, it is mirrored byte-for-byte instead.

## The spec (Mechanism B)

`hod-spec.js` does the mechanical half — folder, prototypes, `DESIGN.md`, token table, asset
inventory, file tree, and a **route map** pre-filled from the screen states it finds in the
prototype. You author the prose over the `TODO` markers.

Required sections, in order: title `# Handoff: <Project> — <Feature>`, then `Overview`,
`About the Design Files`, `Fidelity`, the scope body, `Interactions & Behavior`,
`State Management`, `Design Tokens`, `Assets`, `Files`. Full guidance and the optional
high-value sections are in `references/spec-sections.md`.

**The route map is the single most valuable thing you will write.** A prototype multiplexes every
screen through one state machine and has no routing; the target needs real routes. Nobody but you
can make that mapping, and no amount of reading the HTML gives it to the receiving agent for free.

Be exact. Specify **algorithms**, not descriptions — a strength meter gets its scoring rule and
per-score color and width, not "shows password strength". Quote copy verbatim. Factor shared chrome
out once. A developer who was not in the conversation must be able to build from the README alone.

**Screenshots: ask, default no.** Real bundles carry none.

## Validation gates

Phase 03 hard-fails on: `_ds_sync.json` present, re-suffixed sources, unfilled README slots, a
missing `CODING AGENTS` heading, anything unexpected at bundle root, root-level screenshots, an
unparseable adherence config, or an adherence config that disagrees with the DS manifest.

It **warns** on offline-completeness and missing font binaries. Those describe the source, not our
work: the mirror is verbatim, so a project whose design system `@import`s a remote font produces a
bundle that needs the network. Report it; do not silently "fix" it by rewriting the mirror. Pass
`--strict` when the user needs a genuinely offline-complete bundle and would rather fail than ship.

`--spec <slug>` validates the authored document instead: required sections present and ordered,
zero `TODO` markers, prototypes present, and the reference-not-artifact statement made up front.

## Reporting back

Close by telling the user, in this order: the **exact archive path** (or the prompt), what the
bundle contains, every `WARN` the run produced and what it means for them, and — when a spec was
authored — which sections still need their judgement. Never claim a handoff is ready while a gate
is `BLOCKED`.
